DESCRIPTION
    tailp (tail+) - Outputs, filters and highlights text from file(s) on disk, network and archives.
    Inspired by tail and grep command line utilities.

QUICK REFERENCE (EXAMPLES)
    1. Print last 10 lines from file and follow changes. Truncate long lines:
           tailp c:\windows\WindowsUpdate.log -n 10 -f -t

    2. Same as (1), but shows only lines containing "COMAPI" or "START", follow all *.log files:
           tailp -t c:\windows\*.log -n 10 -f -S COMAPI -S START

    3. Same as (2), and highlight ClientId by using regex:
           tailp -t c:\windows\*.log -n 10 -f -S COMAPI -S START -R -L "ClientId = .*"

    4. Shows AssemblyInfo.cs files in archive, that does NOT contains * char in AssemblyVersion:
           tailp e:\3.rar\AssemblyInfo.cs* -S AssemblyVersion -H *

DETAILED REFERENCE
    tailp [PARAMS] <file(s)> [PARAMS] <file(s)> ...

    <file(s)>:
        One or more files. Masks * and ? are allowed.
        Supported archives: ZIP, RAR, 7z.
          * RAR5 not supported
          * SOLID RAR archives not supported
        Examples:
          c:\*.txt                All text files in c:\, including subdirectories
          c:\1.rar                All files in archive 1.rar.
          c:\1.rar\*.txt          All text files in archive 1.rar. Recursion is always used.
          c:\1.rar\2\dummy.txt    The file dummy.txt in folder 2 of archive 1.rar.

PARAMS / GENERIC
    -h|--help                          Shows this information.

PARAMS / FILES
   -nr|--non-recursive                 Search files in current directory only.
                                         Applicable only when * or ? mask are used.

    -c|--location <LOCATION>           Starts to read file from specified LOCATION;
                                         Supported formats: p(percent), b(bytes).
                                         Examples: 80p, 102400b.

    -f|--follow                        Output appended data as the file(s) grows.
                                         If file is removed or replaced, following starts from
                                           beginning.

PARAMS / OUTPUT
    -n|--lines <NUM>                   Output the last NUM lines.
                                         Only filtered lines are counted.
                                         In "follow" mode, only first processing of file(s) skips
                                           lines.
    -n|--lines <+NUM>                  Output starting with line NUM.
                                         Only filtered lines are counted.

    -q|--quiet|--silent                Never output headers giving file names.
    -v|--verbose                       Always output headers giving file names.
                                         By default, file name is showing when several files are
                                           found.

    -N|--line-number                   Prefix each line of output with the 1-based line number
                                         within file.
                                         If -c|--location param is used, line numbers are
                                           calculated relative to starting location.
                                         If -l|--logical-lines param is used, logical line numbers
                                           are calculated.

    -t|--truncate                      Truncates long lines at console width.
                                         If PATTERN is not matched, line is truncated from end.
                                         If PATTERN is matched, unmatched parts of line is
                                           truncated.
                                         Truncated text is replaced by ">" at the end or by "<...>"
                                           in the middle.

    -A|--after-context <NUM>           Print NUM lines of trailing context after matching lines.
                                         Places a line containing a group separator (--) before
                                         each match.
    -B|--before-context <NUM>          Print NUM lines of leading context before matching lines.
                                         Places a line containing a group separator (--) before
                                         each match.
    -C|--context <NUM>                 The same as -A <NUM> -B <NUM>

PARAMS / MATCHING											  
    -l|--logical-lines <MARKER>        Treats several text lines as a singe logical line (message),
                                         if line NOT begin with <MARKER>.
                                         Examples for <MARKER>:
                                           2017-    : for logs beginning with date/time;
                                           <        : for logs beginning with line number in <NNN>
                                                      format.

    -L|--highlight <PATTERN>           Highlighting matched text
    -S|--show <PATTERN>                Showing only lines, having matched pattern
    -H|--hide <PATTERN>                Do not showing lines, having matched pattern
                                         -L, -S and -H params may be added multiple times
                                         If no -S and -H params are provided, entire file is printed
                                         If both -S and -H pattern matches, line is hided 
                                         If -l|--logical-lines param is used, matching applies to
                                           logical line

    -R|--regex                         By default tailp uses string comparison to filter or
                                         highlight text.
                                       By providing this param, .NET Framework regular expression
                                         engine is used instead.

    -o|--comparison-option <OPTION>    Comparison options used for -l, -S and -H params. One of
                                         following: CurrentCulture, CurrentCultureIgnoreCase,
                                           InvariantCulture, InvariantCultureIgnoreCase
                                         See .NET docs for StringComparison enum for details
                                         By default, InvariantCultureIgnoreCase is used
                                         Ignored, when -R|--regex is used

    -a|--all                           By default, multiple -S|--show and -H|--hide patterns are
                                         combined using OR operator. Provides -a param to use AND
                                         operator.

NOTES
    * When reading from file, each tab character is replaced by 4 (four) spaces;
    * PARAMS and files may be mixed in any order;
    * When several files are followed, each file is output in different color;
    * Each matched token is output in different color;
    * Processing progress is shown in window title and in task bar;
    * Press Ctrl+C to end monitoring.
